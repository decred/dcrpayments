php-addressgen
====

This is a PoC-quality development shim for generating Decred addresses.

Requires:

- BLAKE-256 module: https://github.com/dcrpayments/PHP_Blake
- GMP module: http://php.net/manual/en/book.gmp.php

There is a simple example that derives addresses from extended public keys:

- php example.php

# Status

- Coin types are being changed soon and this library will have to be changed to
compensate for that.  See https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/976 for
more details.  **THIS MEANS ADDRESSES GENERATED BY THIS LIBRARY WILL BE
CONSIDERED LEGACY SOON AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION.**

- It would be nice to migrate to a more modern PHP BIP32 library such as:
https://github.com/Bit-Wasp/bitcoin-lib-php/blob/master/src/BIP32.php

# History

- Base code is from [bitcoin-payments-for-woocommerce](https://github.com/gesman/bitcoin-payments-for-woocommerce).
- BIP32 implemented by @davecgh.  [Diff](https://gist.github.com/davecgh/8feff6b5ecd66736f96ea010056f06b5) could not
be automatically applied to preserve authorship.
- Decred support implemented by @jolan.
